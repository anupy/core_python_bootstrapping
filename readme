python setup.py  build

python setup.py install

Points to implement and follow while coding.

1.  Namespace / Packages to properly manage the imports.
2.  Will implement pep8 standards in code with using of pep8 tools which rectify and provide reports where we need to do that.
3.  Coding practices to match pep8 and consistency.
4.  Make proper use of pip installations and requirements.txt 
5.  Exception handling (try/except block)
6.  If we are going to interact with database then proper use of ACID / Transactions.
7.  Decorators (Will use if not used)
8.  Common classes and functions to reduce duplicate code (DRY method)
9.  Generators will use to reduce lazy loading or to improve performance.
10. Make a proper use of list, tuple, dict etc. other builtin functions.
11. Debugging methods like pdb etc. to avoid commented codes.
12. Profiling if required.
13. Good / proper use of python modules which by comparing like json etc.
14. Good use of args and kwargs.
15. Caching if needed.
16. Constant file to import into the project
17. Bootstrapping for complete project using setuptools.
        __init__.py
        __main__.py
18. Creating Virtual Environment to install pip in env only.
19. Will decide if we really need to use class base.
20.
